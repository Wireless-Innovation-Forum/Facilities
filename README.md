The TSI-TG will begin work a new project developing the  "Transceiver Next" specification. This project is being undertaken forthe international community of SDRproducts developer who are seeking an openly available, free to access and free to use internationally elaborated standard API for portable SDR Applications and multi-application Transceivers. The project will produce an updated release of WINNF Transceiver Facility originally published in 2009, and will improve the content based on years of implementation experience. The project will also expand the addressed applications to extend the applicability of the standard to include test and measurement, dynamic spectrum allocation, and sensing.
